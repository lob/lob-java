For a step-by-step walkthrough of creating a campaign and exporting failures, see our [Campaigns Guide](https://help.lob.com/best-practices/launching-your-first-campaign).

        to midnight UTC of that date (`2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z`). If a datetime is
        passed, that exact time will be used. A `send_date` passed with no time zone
        will default to UTC, while a `send_date` passed with a time zone will be converted

            the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a date in

            window](#section/Cancellation-Windows) applied to the mailpiece. Until
            the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a date in

            exact time will be used. A `send_date` passed with no time zone will default
            to UTC, while a `send_date` passed with a time zone will be converted

            To include a return envelope with your letter, set to `true` and specify the `perforated_page`. See [pricing](https://www.lob.com/pricing/print-mail#compare) for extra costs incurred.

            the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a date in

            the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a date in

            window](#section/Cancellation-Windows) applied to the mailpiece. Until
            the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a date in
            the format `2017-11-01` is passed, it will evaluate to midnight UTC of

            exact time will be used. A `send_date` passed with no time zone will default
            to UTC, while a `send_date` passed with a time zone will be converted
            to UTC.
