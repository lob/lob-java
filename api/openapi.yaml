        passed, that exact time will be used. A `send_date` passed with no time zone
        will default to UTC, while a `send_date` passed with a time zone will be converted

              * `In Local Area` - The mailpiece is being processed at the destination facility.

              * `Processed for Delivery` - The mailpiece has been greenlit for
                delivery at the recipient's nearest postal facility. The mailpiece
                should reach the mailbox within 1 business day of this tracking
                event.

              * `Re-Routed` - The mailpiece is re-routed due to recipient change of
                address, address errors, or USPS relabeling of barcode/ID tag
                area.

              * `Returned to Sender` - The mailpiece is being returned to sender due
                to barcode, ID tag area, or address errors.

              * `Mailed` - The mailpiece has been handed off to and accepted by USPS
                and is en route. [More about

            window](#section/Cancellation-Windows) applied to the mailpiece. Until
            the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a date in
            the format `2017-11-01` is passed, it will evaluate to midnight UTC of
            that date (`2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z`). If a datetime is passed, that
            exact time will be used. A `send_date` passed with no time zone will default
            to UTC, while a `send_date` passed with a time zone will be converted

            window](#section/Cancellation-Windows) applied to the mailpiece. Until
            the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a date in

            exact time will be used. A `send_date` passed with no time zone will default

        A nested custom envelope object containing more information about the custom envelope used or `null` if a custom envelope was not used.

        Accepts an envelope ID for any customized envelope with available inventory. If no inventory is available for the specified ID, the letter will not be sent, and an error will be returned. If the letter has more than 6 sheets, it will be sent in a blank flat envelope. Custom envelopes may be created and ordered from the dashboard. This feature is exclusive to certain customers. Upgrade to the appropriate [Print & Mail Edition](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/editions) to gain access.
