            pass in `{"variable_name": "Harry"}` to render `Harry`. `merge_variables`
            must be an object. Any type of value is accepted as long as the object
            is valid JSON; you can use `strings`, `numbers`, `booleans`, `arrays`,
            `objects`, or `null`. The max length of the object is 25,000 characters.
            If you call `JSON.stringify` on your object, it can be no longer than
            25,000 characters. Your variable names cannot contain any whitespace or
            any of the following special characters: `!`, `"`, `#`, `%`, `&`, `''`,
            `(`, `)`, `*`, `+`, `,`, `/`, `;`, `<`, `=`, `>`, `@`, `[`, `\`, `]`,
            `^`, `` ` ``, `{`, `|`, `}`, `~`. More instructions can be found in [our
            guide to using html and merge variables](https://lob.com/resources/guides/general/using-html-and-merge-variables).
            Depending on your [Merge Variable strictness](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings/account)
            setting, if you define variables in your HTML but do not pass them here,
            you will either receive an error or the variable will render as an empty
            string.'

            the current time and up to 180 days in the future to send the letter off

            window](#section/Cancellation-Windows) applied to the mailpiece. Until
            the `send_date` has passed, the mailpiece can be canceled. If a date in
            the format `2017-11-01` is passed, it will evaluate to midnight UTC of
            that date (`2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z`). If a datetime is passed, that
            exact time will be used. A `send_date` passed with no time zone will default
            to UTC, while a `send_date` passed with a time zone will be converted
            to UTC.
