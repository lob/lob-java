Java wrapper for the [Lob.com](https://lob.com) API. See the full Lob.com [API Documentation](https://lob.com/docs/java).  For best results, be sure that you're using [the latest version](https://lob.com/docs/java#version) of the Lob API and the latest version of the java wrapper.

## Getting Started

Here's a general overview of the Lob services available, click through to read more.

- [Postcards API](https://lob.com/products/print-mail/postcards)
- [Letters API](https://lob.com/products/print-mail/letters)
- [Checks API](https://lob.com/products/print-mail/checks)
- [Address Verification API](https://lob.com/products/address-verification)

Please read through the official [API Documentation](https://docs.lob.com/) to get a complete sense of what to expect from each endpoint.

### Registration

First, you will need to first create an account at [Lob.com](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/register) and obtain your Test and Live API Keys.

Once you have created an account, you can access your API Keys from the [Settings Panel](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings).

### Installation

Include the following in your `pom.xml` for Maven:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.lob</groupId>
    <artifactId>lob-java</artifactId>
    <version>12.3.7</version>
  </dependency>
  ...
</dependencies>
```

Gradle:

Make sure you [install Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html) and run `gradle init`. Then add this to `app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
var javaMainClass = "";
dependencies {
		...
    implementation("com.lob:lob-java:12.3.7")
}

ext {
   javaMainClass = "<PATH TO YOUR MAIN CLASS>"
}

application {
    // Define the main class for the application.
    mainClass.set(javaMainClass)
}
```

Finally, to build the dependencies, compile, and execute your code, enter this into your terminal:

```
./gradlew build
./gradlew run
```

### Usage

We've provided examples in a separate repository [lob-java-examples](https://github.com/lob/lob-java-examples). It has examples of how to use the lob-java wrapper with some of our core endpoints.

#### Initialization and Configuration
```java
import com.lob;

Lob.init("yourApiKey");
```

You may optionally set an API version. This is useful for testing your code against new API versions before you upgrade.
```java
import com.lob;

Lob.init("yourApiKey", "yourApiVersion");
```

## Testing

You can run all tests with the command `LOB_API_KEY=<your_test_api_key> mvn test` in the main directory.
