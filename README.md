Please read through the official [API Documentation](#api-documentation) to get a complete sense of what to expect from each endpoint.

### Registration

Once you have created an account, you can access your API Keys from the [Settings Panel](https://dashboard.lob.com/#/settings).

### Installation

Include the following in your `pom.xml` for Maven:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.lob</groupId>
    <artifactId>lob-java</artifactId>
    <version>7.0.0</version>
  </dependency>
  ...
</dependencies>
```

Gradle:

```groovy
compile 'com.lob:lob-java:7.0.0'
```

### Usage

We've provided examples in the `lob-java-examples/` package that has examples of how to use the lob-java wrapper with some of our core endpoints.

#### Initialization and Configuration
```java
import com.lob;

Lob.init("yourApiKey");
```

You may optionally set an API version. This is useful for testing your code against new API versions before you upgrade.
```java
import com.lob;

Lob.init("yourApiKey", "yourApiVersion");
```
